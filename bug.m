In Objective-C, a tricky bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, especially when dealing with weak references.  If an object is deallocated while it's still being observed, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  For instance, if observer A observes object B's property, and B deallocates before removing A as an observer, then sending KVO notifications will attempt to access deallocated memory in A's observer method. This is because KVO uses retain cycles internally. 

```objectivec
// Example: potential memory issue with weak observers
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id<MyObserverProtocol> observer;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    // ... some code ...
    [self removeObserver:self.observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty"]; // Crucial to remove observer
}
@end
```
