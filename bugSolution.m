To fix this, always ensure that observers are explicitly removed using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` before the observed object is deallocated.  This is typically done in the `-dealloc` method of the observed object or any method that might affect the object's lifespan.

```objectivec
// Solution: add observer removal in dealloc method or other cleanup methods
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id<MyObserverProtocol> observer;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    [self addObserver:self.observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:nil];
}
- (void)dealloc {
    [self removeObserver:self.observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

It's also good practice to use `- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:` method in observer object to check for valid observed object.  Alternatively consider using blocks based KVO for improved safety.
